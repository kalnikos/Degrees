# Degrees
The main purpose of this project is to extract some conclusions about the given data features. I applied some basic statistics and visualization techniques in order to understand the diastribution of the data. After that, I was able to answer some relevant questions such as: Which students made the highest average degree based on: the group in which they belonged, the level of education and their gender. In addition, I tried to classify the degrees and checked the impact that preparation may have had on their degrees.

Finally, I realized that the course which was difficult for all students was Math.  I was aiming to understand if preparation is necessary in order to achieve a higher grade by comparing males to females with or without preparation.

## The Degrees based on the Education

### The course that was difficult for all the student was Math. Compare males and females with preparation or without before the course and examine if itâ€™s necessary to pick a course before the exams based on the pass grade
